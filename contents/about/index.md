My academic interests are mostly machine learning, especially 'big
learning' - distributed and parallel methods applied to large-scale
problems. I've had experience implementing large-scale machine
learning systems at Facebook, and I'm comfortable working in C++,
Python, Go, R, Haskell, Rust, MatLab, and other languages. See my
[GitHub profile][] for some of my open-sourced code - for example,

+ [A highly efficient Go implementation of random forests and boosted decision trees][dt].
+ [A Python implemention of Microsoft's AdPredictor (a Bayesian online probit regression model)][ap].
+ The first Haskell implementations (that I can find) of
[Hopfield networks][] and [gradient boosted decision trees][bdt].
+ [A short and sweet Python kernel SVM implementation][svmpy] (for
  pedagogical purposes).

I've made some signficant contributions to larger open-source
projects such as

+ [Improving performance of regression algorithms in `scikit-learn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/2944),

and some minor ones, such as
+ [Cleanups](https://github.com/torch/cutorch/pull/5) to the [Torch][]
deep learning library.
+ [Fixing crashes when parsing malformed YAML in Clang](http://reviews.llvm.org/D1236),
+ Minor cleanups to
  [Chromium](https://codereview.chromium.org/177123004) and
  [LLVM](http://reviews.llvm.org/D3278)

I'm currently a member of the [Facebook AI Research Group][] (FAIR),
working on large-scale problems in machine intelligence. I recently
finished graduate school in mathematical statistics at
[Trinity College, Cambridge][], graduating with distinction (the
highest grade). Before graduate school, I worked on machine learning
systems at Facebook from April 2012 until starting graduate school in
October 2013, working on all aspects of the advertising machine
learning platform, from feature engineering to the inference platform
to the real-time serving system.

Before Facebook, I did my honours degree in mathematics at the
[University of Sydney][], graduating with first class honours and the
university medal in mathematics, as the student with the highest GPA
in the Faculty of Science. My [honours thesis][thesis] was on advanced
Levy process models for multivariate credit risk, supervised by Marek
Rutkowsi. I interned and then worked at [Goldman Sachs][] in Sydney as
a quant, first on the FICC structuring and then algorithmic trading in
the last year of my degree.
