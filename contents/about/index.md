I'm currently at graduate school in mathematical statistics at Trinity
College, Cambridge.  Before graduate school, I worked on machine
learning projects at Facebook from 2012, focusing on ads optimization
and feed ranking.

Before Facebook, I did my honours degree in mathematics at the
University of Sydney, graduating with first class honours and the
university medal in mathematics.  I worked at Goldman Sachs in
algorithmic trading in the last year of my degree.
