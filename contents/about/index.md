My academic interests are mostly machine learning, especially 'big
learning' - distributed and parallel methods applied to large-scale
problems. I've had experience implementing large-scale machine
learning systems at Facebook, and I'm comfortable working in C++,
Python, Go, R, Haskell, Rust, MatLab, and other languages. See my
[GitHub profile][] for some of my open-sourced code - for example,

+ [A highly efficient Go implementation of random forests and boosted decision trees][dt].
+ [A Python implemention of Microsoft's AdPredictor (a Bayesian online probit regression model)][ap].
+ The first Haskell implementations (that I can find) of
[Hopfield networks][] and [boosted decision trees][bdt].
+ [A short and sweet Python kernel SVM implementation][svmpy] (for pedagogical purposes).

I'm currently at graduate school in mathematical statistics at
[Trinity College, Cambridge][]. I'm doing this as part of a PhD in
Statistics at the [University of California, Berkeley][]. Before graduate
school, I worked on machine learning systems at Facebook from April 2012
until starting graduate school in October 2013, working on all aspects
of the advertising machine learning platform, from feature engineering
to the inference platform to the real-time serving system.

Before Facebook, I did my honours degree in mathematics at the
[University of Sydney][], graduating with first class honours and the
university medal in mathematics, as the student with the highest GPA
in the Faculty of Science. My [honours thesis][thesis] was on advanced Levy process
models for multivariate credit risk, supervised by Marek Rutkowsi. I
interned and then worked at [Goldman Sachs][] in Sydney as a quant,
first on the FICC structuring and then algorithmic trading in the
last year of my degree.
