I'm a member of the [Facebook AI Research Group][] (FAIR),  working on
large-scale problems in machine intelligence.  I'm currently applying deep learning methods to tasks in computer vision and natural language processing.

Before joining FAIR, I was a graduate student in mathematical statistics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where I graduated with distinction. Before Cambridge, I worked on Facebook's advertising optimization group, building large-scale machine learning models for understanding users and advertisements.

I studied mathematics at the University of Sydney, where I graduated with first class honours, the university medal, and the Joye Prize for the top student in the Faculty of Science, out of over 6,000 students. I interned at Goldman Sachs as a quantitative analyst on the FICC and algorithm trading desks in my final year of my undergraduate degree.
